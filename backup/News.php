Southern Section Ph.D. Scholarships for the 2017-18 academic year.
Tan was invited to speak at the Southern Section Annual Conference in Nashville on September 20-21 and gave a brief summary
of her current and past research on air pollution modelling. She talked about her previous study on the assessment of the cost
and benefit in air quality control and introduced her current study on global deposition of nitrogen and sulfur.
The $1,200 scholarship helps fulfill the mission of A&WMA, which is to assist in the professional development and critical
environmental decision-making of its members to benefit society.
